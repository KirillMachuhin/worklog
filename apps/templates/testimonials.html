<p>DoneCal is a lightweight and dead simple online calendar to help you keep track of dates and events. This app provides a different approach in working with online timesheets and task records and also serves as a great alternative for calendars like Google Calendar and iCal.</p>

<p>Compared to a few corporate calendaring apps I've used, yours looks nice.</p>
