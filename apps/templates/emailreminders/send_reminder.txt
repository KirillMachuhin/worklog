INSTRUCTIONS:

Just hit reply and type at the start of the email as you would enter
an event normally on DoneCal with tags and everything. To enter
multiple events separate them by two line breaks. A single line break
sets the description of the event. 

If you want it to be an hourly even write a number followed by the letter 'h'. Like this for example:

 14:45 Working on #projectX like Sam said

If you want to specify exactly when it happened enter it like a 24 hour clock or with AM/PM. Like this for example:

 10.30am 1h Helped Santa with gift wrapping

If you don't start the line with a time, the event becomes and all-day event ignoring any duration you've also entered.
