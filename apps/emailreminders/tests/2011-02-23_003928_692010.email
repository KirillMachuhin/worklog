What did you do *today*?<br>
<br>
<br>
INSTRUCTIONS:<br>
Just hit reply and type at the start of the email as you would enter<br>
an event normally on DoneCal with tags and everything. To enter<br>
multiple events separate them by two line breaks. A single line break<br>
sets the description of the event.<br>
<br>
If you want it to be an hourly even write a number followed by the letter &=
#39;h&#39;. Like this for example:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;14:45 Working on #projectX like Sam said<br>
<br>
If you want to specify exactly when it happened enter it like a 24 hour clo=
ck or with AM/PM. Like this for example:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;10:30 1h Helped Santa with gift wrapping<br>
<br>
If you don&#39;t start the line with a time, but do start the line with a d=
uration it will assume it&#39;s noon your local time.<br>
